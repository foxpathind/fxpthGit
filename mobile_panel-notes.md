--------------

I’ve been making notes on my thoughts on mobile and I realized that as I’m not directly in the business of developing I have mostly general observations and personal  desires and opinions. As I laid things out it seemed that I might benefit from the hearing from the rest of you about how my perspective would fit in.

I’ll just send these incomplete comments for now and hope they make some sense and are useful to you.

Very generally I’ve been thinking lately about app/device interoperability and user data access. As life tracking and activity management (including communications) become more a part of life with wearables, smart homes, cars, offices etc. becoming more prevalent I’m feeling that easy access to one’s data, one’s family’s data will become a important component of the mobile ecosystem. As such the content itself is and needs to be distributed to an increasing number of touchpoints and so people will become more data aware and want access and control to review and distribute, analyze and manage that data for themselves. When a brand has an opportunity to enhance a service related to the brand, say in shopping, travel etc I believe this will become an important factor in demonstrating a lasting customer relationship.

I know less about the media delivery context that needs to be monetized but my feeling and impression I get from the industry is that there is creative design problem that must be solved. Much display in this context annoying even to industry participants. Agencies could play a role in helping to propose more options speculatively 

Brands want to participate and mobile advertising, campaign or product strategies, and they will need to carefully balance cost, platforms, app churn, content providers, media properties,  in-app in-game opportunities etc. I think this is a challenge right now to get this right and some efforts are just wasted when there isn’t clear utility opportunity for a brand. 

Looking forward to talking Friday and the panel. let me know if you think of anything else I might be able to contribute

Conference call number: (213) 226-1066, code: 776-971-634#
Below is the description for "The Agency + Brand Roundtable" on Jan 6 at 3pm on the main stage in the Belmont Ballroom, Level 4 of the Cosmopolitan Hotel .

Email from Mark Silva:
<In the meantime, quick homework assignment. Will you please send to Kirin and me by COB tomorrow 2-3 hot-topics/passion-points around the theme of mobile innovation, investment, buy/build, support and ROI?

We can take areas you have a strong POV in and weave it into the larger topic of how agencies and brands need to participate and thrive in the app-economy/reality in 2015 and the future.>>

PANEL DESCRIPTION:
APPNATION is pleased to, once again, partner with the American Association of Advertising Agencies, (the 4A’s) and welcome a diverse group of senior executives from across the industry to offer their thoughts on the State of APPNATION and everything from in-app advertising, the roles of exchanges and RTB, the roles of native advertising and the branded app for leading marketers, marketing and advertising strategies for indie app developers, and perspectives on the exploding Internet of Things ecosystem and app marketplace.  Join this group of leading app marketers and advertising experts to hear about how big consumer brands and indie app publishers, alike, are approaching, and investing in, the mobile app revolution.





Brands want a useful and relevant participation in mobile.

Many have struggled somewhat in finding the appropriate solution: native branded app, media advertising, facebook, mobile video, balancing strategic considerations like costs, audience and time-to-live, measurement.

Although mobile use is stupendous, mobile itself isn't a mass medium. There are probably only a few mass channels and few mobile media channels
